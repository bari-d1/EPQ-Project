            <h1 class="question">Why would you need a private tutor?</h1>

                <li>Learning privately elminates all distractions that would be incurred in a class. </li> 
                <li>No other students struggling for the teachers attention.</li>
                <li>You can focus on areas of a subject which you have problems in rather than covering a whole curriculum.</li>
                <li>You can be free as you will be in a confortable environment.</li>
                <li>You are free to ask as many questions as you want.</li>
                <li>The one-on-one approach, when working with a private tutor, can help students to become more confident about their knowledge in the subject.</li>
